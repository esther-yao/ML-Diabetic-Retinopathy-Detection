# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
* Collaborative project for the 2020 Spring Machine Learning class
* Project presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLoI1-KFnpQ
* <b>Goal: Trained Logistic Regression, CNN, and AlexNet to diagnose diabetic retinopathy with 25,000 color fundus photos</b>
* Description: Diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. Currently, the detection for this illness is usually performed by trained clinicians with fundus photography of the retina, which demands much time and expertise. Our goal is to use color fundus photographs as input, and train a neural network to classify the patient into the five stages of Diabetic Retinopathy.
* <b>Result: Achieved 23% higher accuracy than the baseline model</b>
